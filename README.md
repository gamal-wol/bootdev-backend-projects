# Backend Development Projects - Boot.dev Curriculum

Hands-on projects built while completing Boot.dev's backend development path. Each project demonstrates practical backend engineering skills through real-world implementations.

## About

This repository showcases practical backend projects I've built from scratch while following the [Boot.dev curriculum](https://github.com/bootdotdev/curriculum). These aren't just tutorials - each project is a fully functional application that applies computer science fundamentals and backend engineering principles.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** - Core programming fundamentals and backend development
- **Go** - Systems programming and high-performance backend services
- **HTTP Servers** - Building web servers and RESTful APIs
- **Databases** - Data persistence, SQL, and database design

## Projects

*Projects will be added here as I complete them*
